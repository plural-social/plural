# Server Accounts

An _account_ on this server defines how a user logs in to the server.

  The PluralTown User Model
</Heading>

The [PluralTown Software](https://software.plural.town) that powers this server
has a very flexible model when it comes to user identity.
It's one of the main features, but also comes with some complexity that needs to be explained.

On many other social media platforms, you have a single identity, that includes:

- how you login (e.g. username + password)
- who you are (staff role, what other accounts have allowed you to see their private content)
- how you appear to the world (your username that can be `@` mentioned, your display name)

We call those components Accounts, [Identities][identity], and [Profiles][], respectively.

Multiple [Identities][identity] can share a single [Account][], and can have [Profiles][].

[account]: /docs/terms/account/
[identity]: /docs/terms/identity/
[profiles]: /docs/terms/profile/

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout term="Account">{children}</DocLayout>;
