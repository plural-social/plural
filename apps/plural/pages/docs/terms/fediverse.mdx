# The Fediverse

The *fediverse* refers to a collection of social media platforms and servers
that can communicate with each other through common protocols ([ActivityPub](/docs/terms/ActivityPub/))

## Types of Servers

There are many different software platforms that can communicate with servers
in the fediverse, including:

- [Mastodon][], [Pleroma][], [PluralTown][], [Misskey][], and [Calckey][],
  which all allow posting short "notes" (sometimes called "toots")
- [WriteFreely][] for sharing long-form content/creating a blog
- [Mobilizon][] for sharing and RSVPing to events
- [PeerTube][] for posting online videos
- [Pixelfed][] for sharing photos

## Interactions

Each server on the Fediverse may be slightly different, but in general,
if you have an account on one Fediverse server, you can:

- Follow/subscribe to be notified when content is posted to someone's page/feed/timeline
- Leave a comment/reply to content
- Share/boost content so people following you can see the content
- "Like" content
